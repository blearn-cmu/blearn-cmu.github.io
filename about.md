# About Bryan Learn

I am a research developer with interests in graph theory, game design, machine learning, database technology, and computer networking.

I work at Carnegie Mellon University with the [OH!Lab](https://ohlabcmu.wordpress.com/) in HCII. I am currently the lead developer for the PeerPresents web application.

My career at CMU began at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center where I supported high performance networking research projects for five years. I focused on **Software Defined Networking** and **TCP/IP**.

During my graduate and undergraduate studies I focused on high performance computing. With the support of grants my advisor obtained, I built several Beowulf clusters to provide Slippery Rock University with more distributed environments for curriculum use. I utilized those resources to develop reference implementations of common distributed algorithms using MPI and GPGPU programming techniques.

I use my personal website as a [live resume](https://www.bryanlearn.com/).

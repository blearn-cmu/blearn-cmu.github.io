# About

I am a research developer with experience writing **Python** and **Node.js** back-ends, storing telemetry data in **noSQL** databases, and writing web front-ends using **JavaScript** frameworks. I began studying machine learning in 2017 and am currently pursuing a M.S. in Machine Learning from CMU.

I work at Carnegie Mellon University with the [OH!Lab](https://ohlabcmu.wordpress.com/) in HCII. I am currently the lead developer for the PeerPresents application.

My career at CMU began at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center where I supported high performance networking research projects for five years. I focused on **Software Defined Networking** and the evolution of the **TCP/IP** stack.

During my graduate and undergraduate studies I focused on high performance computing. With the support of grants my advisor obtained, I built several Beowulf clusters to provide Slippery Rock University with more distributed environments for curriculum use. I utilized those resources to develop reference implementations of common distributed algorithms using MPI and GPGPU programming techniques.
